# Analysis for the paper GEESE

The data used for the analysis is a mix of experimental data first used in 
Vega Yon et al. (2021)--the [aphylo](https://github.com/USCbiostats/aphylo) model--
and data from the Gene Ontology Project.

To execute the programs included in this repository, you will need both aphylo,
and [geese](https://github.com/USCbiostats/geese).
